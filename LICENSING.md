# Dual Licensing

The ZeroCopySkiplist library is dual licensed to provide maximum flexibility for both open source and commercial use.

## License Options

You may choose to use this software under the terms of either:

### Option 1: BSD 3-Clause License
- **Permissive license** allowing commercial use with minimal restrictions
- **Full text**: See [LICENSE-BSD](LICENSE-BSD) file
- **Use case**: Ideal for commercial applications, proprietary software, and projects requiring maximum flexibility

### Option 2: GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1 or later
- **Copyleft license** that allows linking while preserving source availability for the library itself
- **Full text**: See [LICENSE-LGPL](LICENSE-LGPL) file  
- **Use case**: Suitable for open source projects and applications where you want to ensure the library remains open source

## How to Choose

- **For commercial/proprietary software**: Use the BSD 3-Clause License
- **For open source projects**: Either license works, choose based on your project's licensing philosophy
- **For GPL-licensed projects**: Use the LGPL option for better compatibility

## Rationale

This dual licensing approach serves different user communities:

1. **BSD 3-Clause** enables adoption in commercial and proprietary software without copyleft obligations
2. **GNU LGPL** ensures the library itself remains open source while allowing its use in larger applications
3. **Both options** together maximize the library's utility and adoption across different software ecosystems
